What is this

game experiments in odin with focus on MAGIC

ALL WE DO HERE IS FOR RESEARCHING GAME MAGIC (mostly)

experimenting with different systems
- Saving loading world
- Optimizations, multit-hreading
- Lighting rendering
- Terrain rendering, efficient memory usage, cpu usage
- Hotreloading textures, shaders, models
- World editing, moving models
- Deterministic entity updates
- Recording user input (keys, mouse)
- Save and load game state
- Step game ticks, back and forth.
- Custom physics (since we want to step back game ticks and physics?)
- Proximity chat, sound engine in general
- All systems working with multiplayer

Developer experience is important.
Ease of adding models, changing world, terrain, textures, shaders.
Moving and creating entities when game updates are paused
